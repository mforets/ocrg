## Commonly used notation

*Polynomials*. The standard notation for polynomials with coefficients on a field $\mathbb{K}$, on a scalar (real) variable $t$, is $p(t) \in \mathbb{K}[t]$. Moreover, for polynomials with domain in $\mathbb{R}^n$, we denote $p(x) \in \mathbb{K}^n[x]$.

## How to contribute

If you would like to contribute with an exercise please [send me an email](marcelo-forets.fr) and I will upload it here. Otherwise you can directly do it yourself, you just need a [github](https://github.com/) account (it is free). 

To actually create new content, you can do it in any text editor and save the file in .md ([Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)) format. There exist as well several programs specially conceived to formatting in Markdown. On a personal note, my favorite (for MacOS) is the open-source project [MacDown](macdown.uranusjr.com/).
