## Learning through problem-solving

This repository consists in a growing collection of slides, exercises and some code related to:

* Mathematical optimization, in particular convex optimization at the level of [Boyd and Vandenberghe's book](http://stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/)

* Control theory, in particular optimal control, at the level of [Liberzon's book](http://liberzon.csl.illinois.edu/publications.html)

## How to contribute

If you would like to contribute with material please send a PR (pull request, through github), or otherwise [send me an email](marcelo-forets.fr), and I will upload it here. 

For the content I have been using a text editor (Atom), and working in the .md fomat (for [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)). Another good Markdown-specialized editor (for MacOS) is the open-source project [MacDown](macdown.uranusjr.com/). If you enjoy working online, check also [stack edit](https://stackedit.io).

## Code

Some of the exercises are written using [SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org/) free open source mathematics software. You can try it online at the [SageMath cell](http://sagecell.sagemath.org/); for the full-featured app check the [SageMath Cloud](http://sagecell.sagemath.org/).
