## Exercises and Solutions on Convex Optimization

### Exercises from [BV]

| Exercise #  |    Main topics        |
|:-----:|:------------:|

The source of these exercises is [BV].

### Additional exercises on Convex Optimization

| Exercise #  |    Main topics        | 
|:-----:|:---------------:|
| [1.1](./more-exercises-convex-optimization/1-1-ad.html) | convex set |

The source of these exercises is [BVAdd].


### Notation

The standard notation for polynomials with coefficients on a field $\mathbb{K}$, on a scalar (real) variable $t$, is $p(t) \in \mathbb{K}[t]$. Moreover, for polynomials with domain in $\mathbb{R}^n$, we denote $p(x) \in \mathbb{K}^n[x]$.

## Notes on Convex Optimization

These notes are mainly from the book by Boyd and Vandenberghe [BV].

| Chapter   |    Main topics        | 
|:--------:|:-----------------------------------------:|
| [Convex sets](./notes-eng/convex-sets.html) | definition of convexity; operations that preserve convexity; basic classes of convex sets: polyhedra, cones (proper cones, dual cones); generalized inequalities |
| [Convex functions](./notes-eng/convex-functions.html) |  convex functions |




## How to contribute

If you would like to contribute with an exercise please [send me an email](marcelo-forets.fr) and I will upload it here. Otherwise you can directly do it yourself, you just need a [github](https://github.com/) account (it is free). 

To actually create new content, you can do it in any text editor and save the file in .md ([Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)) format. There exist as well several programs specially conceived to formatting in Markdown. On a personal note, my favorite (for MacOS) is the open-source project [MacDown](macdown.uranusjr.com/).
