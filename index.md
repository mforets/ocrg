### Notation

The standard notation for polynomials with coefficients on a field $\mathbb{K}$, on a scalar (real) variable $t$, is $p(t) \in \mathbb{K}[t]$. Moreover, for polynomials with domain in $\mathbb{R}^n$, we denote $p(x) \in \mathbb{K}^n[x]$.

## Notes in Convex Optimization

These notes are mainly from the book by Boyd and Vandenberghe [BV].
